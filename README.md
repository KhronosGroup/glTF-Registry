# glTF-Registry

**NOTE** this registry is not yet official, and is published solely to
collect feedback from glTF Working Group members.

The glTF-Registry repository contains the glTF 2.0 Specification, as well as
links to older specifications and extensions in Github.

It is also used as a backing store for the web view of the registry at
https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF/ ; commits to the main branch of this
repository will be reflected there.

Interesting files in this repository include:

* index.php - toplevel index page for the web view. This relies on PHP
  include files found elsewhere on www.khronos.org and so is not very useful
  in isolation.
* specs/ - glTF specification documents.
